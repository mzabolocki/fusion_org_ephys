### Figures
-------

Example notebooks for the generation of figures used for Reumann et al. Notebooks are separated fo rmain and extended data figures.

Notebooks only show figures generated using data from the relevant pipelines associated with gCAMP and silicon probe aquisitions. 

Analysis pipelines required for the figure plots can be found [here](https://github.com/mzabolocki/miscos_ephys/tree/main/analysis). 

File paths to processed files are set for MacOS.
